# MyFirstIonicApp

Aim of this project is to build an Ionic app and connect it to a RESTful API (python).

Helpful material to get started can be found here:
https://ionicframework.com/docs/building/starting

Instructions on running the app:

I recommend pycharm for the BettyAppPython project and atom as an editor for BettyApp

Start the python app in app.py

Start the ionic app from the commandline within the BettyApp folder by typing 'ionic serve'
